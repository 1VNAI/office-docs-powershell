# MSCommerce PowerShell Overview

The **MSCommerce** PowerShell module is now available on [PowerShell Gallery](https://aka.ms/allowselfservicepurchase-powershell-gallery). The module includes a **PolicyID** parameter value for **AllowSelfServicePurchase** that lets you control whether users in your organization can make self-service purchases.

- View a list of applicable products and whether self-service purchase is enabled, disabled, or allows trials without a payment method
- View or modify the current setting for a specific product to either enable or disable it
- View or modify the setting for trials without payment methods
